# WinXRunPE x86 x64
This is a RunPE that can inject 32-bit executables into 32-bit processes. And 64-bit executables into 64-bit executables. The 32-bit edition actually runs on 64-bit compiled executables. So no more forced to target 32-bit when using RunPE.

I'd be glad if you collaborated with me on this project. So fork it today!
